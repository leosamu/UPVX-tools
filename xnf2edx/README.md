XNF2EDX README.md
===================
XNF is an Excel sheet data format that some teachers use to generate their courses offline.

xnf2edx.py 

This tool generates a tar.gz file that edx will accept with the platform import tool.

Beware!!!
===================
Our code-monkeys are changing the XNF format so the python script may not work correctly. We will change this message when it works correctly again.
