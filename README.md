UPVX-tools README.md
===================

A collection of miscellaneous tools for use with the edX platform at UPV[X].

These tools might not be production quality - they may not be reviewed, may not do
error-handling, etc.  Use at your own risk.

This tools will be pulled to the main platform as soon as they reach that production quality.



Current directories include:
 - xnf2edx (tool for convert xnf format files into a targz that edx accepts)
 - movechapter (tool to move a chapter from one course in another)
